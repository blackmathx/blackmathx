					Popping into existence on the internet with a blog feels like playing basketball with just socks on. 
					I don’t know what this could turn into, but speaking of basketball, the Indiana Pacers are 2-0 in the 
					semi-finals against the New York Knicks. I watch the Playoffs, after all, I live in Indiana and
					I am a Pacers fan.

					I don’t know what yet I’ll write about and show my superb creative and reasoning abilities, but I know 
					math and computers well and I am a Software Engineer by day. I think you will find something cool or 
					distracting eventually.

					It is also Memorial Day Weekend and tomorrow the 109th Indy 500 is taking place. Watching the race with a favorite 
					driver is like watching a roulette wheel spin with all your money on your lucky number. Tonight, thousands of people 
					are in Speedway ready for a sold out race in the morning.  Not me though. I am imagining my new role as chief blogger 
					and brainstorming something serious or intellectual to write about. I may end up just posting some pictures 
					and calling it a day.
